       <p3>Nigiri–These are the original and most simple sushi options. Most nigiri are oval balls of sushi rice topped with fresh, masterfully sliced pieces of fish. One order normally comes with two pieces of sushi. If you are a little wary of the raw fish thing, you might want to start with the tamago (egg) or ebi (shrimp) nigiri. <br>Sashimi– Sashimi are slices of raw fish enjoyed with a side of soy sauce for dipping. It is not really ‘sushi’ per se, but it is commonly eaten at sushi restaurants because it’s basically nigiri without the rice. <br>Tekka Maki– These are mini maki rolls. They are smaller, so normally have one ingredient in the middle. Common tekka maki rolls are maguro (tuna), cucumber, and takuan (yellow pickled vegetable). A cucumber tekka maki might be a good one for a sushi-newbie to start with. </div> </div>
